    "# Lab 5: Causal Inference with Randomized Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in class, the problem of causal inference is the fact that we cannot observe, for the same individual, the outcome when they are put under a treatment and the same outcome when they are not put under the treatment. This means that we cannot find the individual effect of the treatment, which is the difference of the outcomes in either circumstance. However, we can approximate the expected difference at the population level, the **average treatment effect**. We also touched upon the fact that we cannot do this easily with observational data, as our observations may be biased because of underlying relationships between the real treatment and unobserved variables, meaning that a simple regression of the outcome on the treatment will not render a faithful approximation of the real. The following example will help illustrate how this failure to consider selection bias can lead us to both type 1 and type 2 errors.\n",

    "## Type 1 error:\n",

    "Imagine we are researchers in the first phase of research for a new drug aimed at reducing blood cholesterol levels. Because this is the first phase, we would like to assess the safety of the treatment. Therefor, we want to quantify the effect the the regime has on lung health. Let $Y(d)$ be the potential outcome of an indicator of overall respiratory health. Let $D$ be the observed treatment variable, and assume first that treatment was not assigned randomly, but that it is correlated with underlying variables lifestyle and demographic characteristics. Formally, we have the following model:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{gather*}\n",
    "Y(0) = \\theta_0+\\epsilon_0\\\\\n",
    "Y(1) = \\theta_1+\\epsilon_1\\\\\n",

    "Y=Y(D)=(1-D)Y(0)+DY(1)\n",
    "\\end{gather*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here. $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ are the averages of their respective potential outcomes, $(\\epsilon_0, \\epsilon_1, \\nu)$ is a random vector of variables that are jointly distributed with mean 0 and covariance $\\Sigma$. $\\epsilon_0$ and $\\epsilon_1$ are determinants of overall lung health like lifestyle, exposure to environmental contaminants, diet, etc. For this specific example, the variable that determines treatment, $\\nu$, is negativelly correlated with $\\epsilon_0$ and $\\epsilon_1$. One way to interpret this is that people with worse overall lifestyle patterns that provoke worse lung health may also tend to have worse blood cholesterol content, and therefor are more likely to seek the treatment in question.\n",
    "\n",

In our research setting, we would interpret this finding as the drug having a negative effect on lung health, even though the true ATE is of 0. This relationship only arises because of underlying variables that determine both $Y(d)$ and $D$ simultaneously. A variable that affects both the propensity of treatment and the outcome is called a **confounder**, and not taking confounders into account can lead to the kinds of issues we are seeing in this example. One way of tackling the issue of confounding is to use randomized treatments. Now in our research example, instead of having a $D$ treatment that is correlated with some unobservables, we randomly assign the treatment to the population of interest. We can simulate that through our code."

The root of the estimation bias is solved by randomization, but the lack of randomization is not the cause of the bias itself. We can find other procedures that can lead us to an unbiased estimate even with a biased treatment. Recall from class that we can identify treatment effects through strong ignorability. We call $D_i$ strongly ignorable conditional on a vector $X$ if it follows:\n",

The first condition, on the other hand, hearkens back to a topic we have explored before.
