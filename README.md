# LASSO Potential Outcomes for Randomized Controlled Trials

A comprehensive statistical analysis toolkit implementing LASSO regression for high-dimensional data and Potential Outcomes analysis for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). This repository provides cross-platform implementations in Python, R, and Julia, ensuring reproducibility and demonstrating professional coding practices across different statistical computing environments.

## Overview

This project implements two sophisticated statistical methodologies:

### 1. LASSO Regression Analysis
High-dimensional linear modeling for predictive analytics using district-wise literacy data from India. The implementation focuses on feature selection and regularization techniques to handle multicollinearity and improve model interpretability.

**Key Features:**
- Regularization path analysis
- Cross-validation for optimal λ selection  
- Feature importance assessment
- Model performance evaluation

### 2. Potential Outcomes and Causal Inference
Advanced causal inference methods for analyzing treatment effects in randomized controlled trials. The analysis includes simulation-based approaches and variable selection techniques.

**Key Features:**
- Average Treatment Effect (ATE) estimation
- Randomization inference
- Covariate balance assessment
- LASSO-based variable selection for causal models
